## Introduction

The Crew is a platform that helps in finding the basic necessity services available in one’s localities such as plumbing, electrical works, beautician,salon or carpentary work. A dedicated platform designed for a service provider makes it handy to market the services and also can manage his work online, as well as for customer to book and avail any service at any given point of time. The Crew is a responsive platform, hence users can access it across all devices. Our goal is to make the best user experience UI design and easy to use.
